# Diabetes-Readmission-SQL-Project
SQL data cleaning and exploratory analysis on the Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset (1999–2008).
 Diabetes Readmission Analysis (SQL)

This project contains SQL scripts for cleaning, standardizing, normalizing, and analyzing a diabetic patient dataset.

 Project Structure

- 1_database_setup.sql – Load and inspect the database/table.
- 2_data_exploration.sql – Explore the dataset and check for anomalies or missing values.
- 3_data_cleaning.sql – Replace invalid placeholders like '?' with NULLs.
- 4_data_standardization.sql – Standardize categorical data for consistency.
- 5_data_normalization.sql – Normalize numerical/categorical columns using lookup tables.
- 6_exploratory_data_analysis.sql – Perform EDA including trends on readmissions, medication changes, and patient profiles.

 Tools Used

- MySQL
- SQL queries

 Goals

- Understand the patterns behind hospital readmissions.
- Clean and prepare raw medical data for analysis.
- Identify high-risk profiles based on medication use, time in hospital, and demographics.

 Dataset Source

The dataset used is `diabetic_data`, containing anonymized hospital records of diabetic patients.
